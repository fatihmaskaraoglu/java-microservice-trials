<h3>General Informations</h3>

> What is the microservice? 

Small autonomous services that work together.
   - REST
   - Small Well Chosen Deployable Units
   - Cloud Enabled

> Challenges 
 - Bounded Context
 - Configuration Management
 - Dynamic Scale Up and Scale Down
 - Visibility
 - Pack of Cards


Notes for challenges: We started with bounded context,
identifying what is the right context for your microservice?
What is the right boundary for your microservice?
We talked about the problem of configuration management.
Hundreds of microservices and a lot of environments
there is tons of configuration
that you would want to manage.
How do we simplify that?
We would want to be able
to dynamically scale up and scale down
and dynamically distribute load among the active instances.
How do we do that?
We want to have great visibility into what's happening
behind the scenes with each of these microservices.
A simple request might involve 10 microservices.
How do I determine which microservice
was the cause for a defect?
How do I know if all my microservices are up and running?
And how do I prevent one microservice being down,
taking down the entire application?
How do I build fault tolerance into my microservices?


> Advantage 
- new technology & process adaption
- dynamic scaling
- faster release cycles
